🎓 Flutter Project Structure & Organization - Complete Guide
Let me teach you the fundamentals before we start coding the VERYGOOD POS app.
📁 Understanding Flutter Project Structure
Why Project Structure Matters

Maintainability: Easy to find and modify code
Scalability: Can grow without becoming messy
Collaboration: Team members can navigate easily
Testing: Organized code is easier to test
Performance: Better imports and dependencies

Flutter Project Anatomy
flutter_project/
├── android/          # Android-specific files
├── ios/              # iOS-specific files
├── lib/              # 🔥 YOUR MAIN CODE GOES HERE
├── test/             # Unit and widget tests
├── web/              # Web-specific files
├── pubspec.yaml      # Dependencies & project config
└── README.md         # Project documentation
🏗️ The lib/ Folder - Your Code Home
Core Principles
1. Separation of Concerns
Each folder has a specific responsibility:
lib/
├── main.dart         # App entry point only
├── models/           # Data structures
├── services/         # External API calls, database
├── screens/          # Full-screen UI components
├── widgets/          # Reusable UI components
├── utils/            # Helper functions, constants
└── providers/        # State management (if using Provider)
2. Feature-Based vs Layer-Based Organization
Layer-Based (What we're using):
lib/
├── models/           # All data models
├── services/         # All services
├── screens/          # All screens
└── widgets/          # All widgets
Feature-Based (Alternative):
lib/
├── authentication/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── screens/
├── menu/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── screens/
└── orders/
    ├── models/
    ├── services/
    └── screens/
